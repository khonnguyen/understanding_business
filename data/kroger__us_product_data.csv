The grapes are then harvested at night and promptly pressed to undergo cool fermentation in 100% stainless steel tanks. An extended fermentation sur lie adds richness, complementing the fruit’s natural zest and acidity.

This bottle of wine opens with aromas of ripe black cherries, blackberries, red berry, and spice. Crafted with grapes grown in the cool climate of California's Central Coast vineyards along the Pacific Ocean, this medium-bodied wine is aged for 10 months in French and American oak barrels. This barrel aging, along with the red grapes' slow ripening process, imparts a pleasing complexity and depth of flavor to this Central Coast wine. With luscious flavors of ripe Bing cherries and blueberry, which are accented by toasty oak and hints of coffee and vanilla flavors, this delicious red wine pairs well with grilled lamb and steak, hearty pasta, strong cheeses, and a variety of other dishes. Feature this California red wine at a wine and cheese party, or enjoy a glass of wine on its own.

This limited-release California red wine blends the craftsmanship of California winemaking with the Southern tradition of bourbon whiskey aging. Crafted using coastal fruit picked at the peak of ripeness from California's Monterey County, this Robert Mondavi red wine features decadent aromas of ripe blackberry. With select lots aged in a combination of new oak barrels as well as used bourbon barrels from a renowned Kentucky distillery, each bottle of wine reflects the expressive character of this original alternative to barrel aging. Deep flavors of black cherry and blackberry are accompanied by notes of vanilla, dried herbs, brown sugar, and toasty oak in this finely aged wine. Bold and flavorful, this cabernet wine tastes of ripe blackberry cobbler, blueberry pie, praline, and sweet vanilla custard with hints of brown sugar, caramel, mocha, coffee, and smoke. Serve this decadent California red wine at a wine and cheese party, or pair it with a charcuterie board and hearty pasta dishes. For optimal enjoyment of this red wine, refrigerate this 750 mL wine bottle for 30 minutes before serving.

This delicious red wine bestows flavors of berries, toasted marshmallow, graham cracker, and chocolate. Medium-bodied and with a pleasing complexity of flavors, this red table wine pairs deliciously with grilled meats, tomato-based pasta dishes, and chili. Many of the grapes used to make this Woodbridge wine are harvested from California vineyards where warm days and cool breezes cultivate fully mature grapes that consistently produce well-balanced and fruit-expressive red table wine. Crafted to increase richness and soften tannins, this bottle of wine has a toasty caramel finish. Store this cabernet sauvignon wine at room temperature, then chill for 30 to 60 minutes and serve at approximately 60 degrees. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi wines are fruit-forward and balanced, making them ideal for everyday enjoyment. Please enjoy our wines responsibly. © 2021 Woodbridge Winery, Acampo, CA.Aromas of cherries, berries, cedar, brown sugar, and toast",,6,,"Nutrition Facts

From our first vintage – brewed in the former Ortigüela winery in 1959 – to the creation of the famous ‘Rioja Bottle’ in 1961 and the unveiling of our new state-of-the-art sustainable winery in 2001, we have been at the forefront of Rioja winemaking.A vibrant expression of Tempranillo from Rioja.

Fermentation is conducted at cool temperatures, mainly in stainless steel tanks to preserve freshness and fruit intensity. A few selected lots are aged in French oak barrels to add depth, complexity and spiciness to the final blend. After initial fermentation, the art of the blending begins. Our winemakers find the perfect blend of wines to create our signature taste. Then the finished blend is bottled for the second fermentation. An average of 18 months’ yeast aging adds complexity, contributing subtle bread dough flavors and layers of creaminess. The wine is disgorged as a brut style and a dosage is added back to balance the wine’s acidity. Brut Prestige then ages another 3 months on the cork to fully marry the dosage to the base wine.This versatile and balanced sparkling wine is perfect for hors d’oeuvres, light seafood, poultry and vegetarian dishes.

This New Zealand sauvignon blanc bestows aromas of passionfruit and guava with hints of citrus. The full flavor and crisp acidity of this elegant white wine are highlighted by a fresh herbal and citrus finish. Carefully chosen, sun-ripened New Zealand grapes undergo cold-soaking prior to fermentation and treatment with spinning cone technology, which removes a portion of the alcohol without impacting the aroma or taste of this Marlborough region white wine. The result is a lower calorie*, reduced alcohol wine with satisfying aroma and taste. Compared to Kim Crawford's original sauvignon blanc with 120 calories per serving and 13% ABV, this easy-drinking, lower alcohol wine has only 70 calories per serving and 7.0% ABV, yet this 100% sauvignon blanc wine still boasts Kim Crawford's signature quality and style.

California’s Mediterranean like climate features sunny days leading to cool nights and a long growing season that offers ideal conditions for the grapes to reach optimal ripeness. During fermentation, we carefully extract the soft, silky tannins and rich color from the grapes before aging on oak for almost a year for heightened richness and complexity. This full-bodied wine has rich flavors of ripe blackberry, cherry and plum that lead to a lovely, juicy mouthfeel balanced by soft notes of espresso and spice.

We’ve remained a family-owned company -- adhering to the high quality standards that Rinaldo and Ezilda set nearly 90 years ago. Each and every syrup, sauce, and smoothie is created with care and pride. That’s a promise from our entire family -- including the more than 100 members that make up the Torani team. We started with just five syrups. Today, you can use more than 100 of our naturally flavored syrups, sauces and beverage bases in coffees, sodas, teas, smoothies, cocktails and more.

Immediately, they knew they had an incredible coffee on their hands - a coffee grown with care, love, and hope. A week later, the three of them traveled to Las Lajas, Ecuador, to visit Diego and his family. The plantation was even more impressive than they anticipated - beautiful citrus trees enveloped the well-groomed plants and the slopes provided just the right amount of steepness. The first batch of The Jaya Family’s coffee arrived to The States on August 17, 2019. Diego, his brother, and his father have mastered the art of not only washed processed coffee but honey processed as well. Fortunately for us, we were able to import both! The washed is a flavorful, dark chocolate coffee. The honey processed is similar to the washed, but the sweetness of the honey creates a milk chocolate aftertaste. Both coffees are second to none. They are dried at a wonderful processing facility with ample sunlight, and they are processed by incredible people with years of experience in the coffee industry.",,1,,,,,0,,,,0086000144932,,13.99,,,,,,,,Pickup;Delivery;Ship,https://www.kroger.com/product/images/large/front/0086000144932,,,,

After all, everyone benefits this way: nature and the farmers, since they get better prices and we get the finest hand-selected goods. And you get shamelessly delicious coffee.

At the conference, the two immediately hit it off. Arturo quickly realized that Ramiro was no ordinary coffee farmer. He not only focuses on his plantation, but he has learned the most intricate details of roasting and being a barista. In the summer of 2019, when Carter and Shane were in Ecuador, they visited Ramiro’s plantation, and it sure didn’t disappoint! The plants were perfectly organized, and the plantation was free of shrubs and weeds. There were multiple different types of coffee: catucai, caturra, Geisha, Pacamara, Tipica, Bourbon, amongst countless others. It was a sight to see, and one we truly appreciated being able to experience. The first 5000lbs of coffee from Ramiro’s plantation in Malacatos, Ecuador, arrived in The States on August 17, 2019. Ramiro’s plantation is just over 5,000 feet above sea level. His various strands of Arabica Coffee are processed organically and harvested with the utmost care. Currently, Ramiro and his son, Javier, take care of the plantation and process the coffees themselves.

From there, Diego and Shane exchanged WhatsApp numbers and immediately formed a friendship. After Shane connected Diego with Arturo, Diego sent Arturo a small sample of his coffee.This sample was inspected and looked over for defects -- however, no issues were found! When Shane and Carter went to Ecuador in July of 2019, they roasted the coffee and tried it. Immediately, they knew they had an incredible coffee on their hands - a coffee grown with care, love, and hope. A week later, the three of them traveled to Las Lajas, Ecuador, to visit Diego and his family. The plantation was even more impressive than they anticipated - beautiful citrus trees enveloped the well-groomed plants and the slopes provided just the right amount of steepness. The first batch of The Jaya Family’s coffee arrived to The States on August 17, 2019. Diego, his brother, and his father have mastered the art of not only washed processed coffee but honey processed as well. Fortunately for us, we were able to import both! The washed is a flavorful, dark chocolate coffee. The honey processed is similar to the washed, but the sweetness of the honey creates a milk chocolate aftertaste. Both coffees are second to none. They are dried at a wonderful processing facility with ample sunlight, and they are processed by incredible people with years of experience in the coffee industry.",,1,,,,,0,,,,0086000144933,,13.99,,,,,,,,Pickup;Delivery;Ship,https://www.kroger.com/product/images/large/front/0086000144933,,,,

At the conference, the two immediately hit it off. Arturo quickly realized that Ramiro was no ordinary coffee farmer. He not only focuses on his plantation, but he has learned the most intricate details of roasting and being a barista. In the summer of 2019, when Carter and Shane were in Ecuador, they visited Ramiro’s plantation, and it sure didn’t disappoint! The plants were perfectly organized, and the plantation was free of shrubs and weeds. There were multiple different types of coffee: catucai, caturra, Geisha, Pacamara, Tipica, Bourbon, amongst countless others. It was a sight to see, and one we truly appreciated being able to experience. The first 5000lbs of coffee from Ramiro’s plantation in Malacatos, Ecuador, arrived in The States on August 17, 2019. Ramiro’s plantation is just over 5,000 feet above sea level. His various strands of Arabica Coffee are processed organically and harvested with the utmost care. Currently, Ramiro and his son, Javier, take care of the plantation and process the coffees themselves.
