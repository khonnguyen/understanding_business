A master roaster watches, knowing that if he pushes them a second too long, they'll burst into flame. White smoke hangs down as the glistening beans turn ebony. This is French Roast, and you can't roast it darker. Straightforward, light-bodied with low acidity, and immensely popular since 1971, our darkest roast is adored for its intense smokiness. Made with the same high-quality 100% arabica beans we use in our cafés and grinded to a universal blend, this coffee is perfect to use in any drip machine, pour over or French press.

Rich, deep, well-rounded flavour and aroma; the howls start up at the roastery when this favourite comes out of the roaster.

The rugged landscape of Muskoka was settled more than a century ago by men and women who were determined to build a new life. When our founder's family carved out a homestead, a stones throw from the towering forests of what is now Algonquin Park, they were driven by a pioneering spirit that continues to this day..

Surviving by their wits and strength, as farmers and lumbermen, the family developed a fierce love for the land and a strong tradition of hard work; values that remain at the heart of the company..

For all of us at the Muskoka Roastery, our deep connection with Muskoka demands that we participate actively to preserve this legacy for future generations. We donate our time, services and at least 1% of our sales to grassroots groups who share our passion and values.",1,"

In Latin America, coffee farms are often run by families, with their own homes on the same land where their coffee grows. We’ve sipped coffee with these farmers for decades, sitting on their verandas, overlooking the lush beauty of the coffee trees rolling out in the distance. Most times it was a lightly roasted coffee like this one. It took us more than 80 tries to get it right—mellow and flavorful with a nice softness. Starbucks VIA Instant: Made with the same 100% arabica beans served at Starbucks stores, Starbucks VIA Instant offers the same Starbucks coffee—in an instant.
100% Arabica Coffee.
